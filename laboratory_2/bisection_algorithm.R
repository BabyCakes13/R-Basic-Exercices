"""
Another algorithm for finding a zero of a function is called the
bisection algorithm. This algorithm starts with two values x1 and x2
for which f (x1) and f (x2) have opposite signs. If f (x) is a continuous
function, then we know a root must lie somewhere between these two
values. We find it by evaluating f (x) at the midpoint, and selecting
whichever half of the interval still brackets the root. We then start
over, and repeat the calculation until the interval is short enough to
give us our answer to the required precision. (a) Use a function to
implement the bisection algorithm to find a root to 6 decimal place
accuracy of f (x) = x^3 + 2x2 âˆ’ 7, given that the root is known to lie
between 0 and 2. (b) Why do you think that your bisection algorithm
is guaranteed to converge for any continuous function which takes
opposite-signed values at 0 and 2, and calculate how many loops it
will take.
